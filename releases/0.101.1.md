**Bug fixes:**

 * Pair programming regular expression improvement\
   The regular expression to detect pair programming authors in git
   datasource has been improved adding more connectors. The following
   list shows the current connectors: - `[aA][nN][dD]` - `&` - `+`
 * Fix fetching authors with min and max dates\
   The old query only returns 10000 items due to ElasticSearch and
   OpenSearch now use `composite` aggregation to paginate all buckets.
